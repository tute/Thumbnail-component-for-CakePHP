*Attachment component for CakePHP* handles file uploads to the file system. If
it's an image file, it creates big and small thumbnails in
@/app/webroot/attachments/photos/{big|small}@ folders; other files are stored
in @/app/webroot/attachments/files@.

I've started it from the public copy at
"@http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/@":http://sabbour.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/enhanced-image-upload-component-for-cakephp-12/
to have a standard way of uploading files to CakePHP projects.


h2. Usage

# Copy @attachment.php@ to @/app/controllers/components/@
# Add component to your controller: @var $components = array('Attachment');@
# In your controller action:
  @$file_path = $this->Attachment->upload($this->data['Model']['Attachment']);@
# In your upload form:
## @echo $form->create('Model', array('type' => 'file'));@
## @echo $form->file('Attachment');@
# In your view, if it's an image:
  @<?= $html->image('/attachments/$folderName/big/'.$data['Model']['file_path']); ?>@

h2. Methods

h3. upload($data)

* @data@: file data array from the form. If it's an image, it calls:

h3. thumbnail($data, $maxw, $maxh, $thumbscalew, $thumbscaleh, $folderName)

* @data@: the image data array from the form
* @maxw/maxh@: maximum width/height for resizing images
* @thumbscalew/thumbscaleh@: maximum width/height scale for resizing images

h3. delete_image($filename, $folderName)

* @filename@: file name of the image
* @folderName@: name of the parent folder of the images

h2. Requirements

* You must store in database @$file_path@ returned by
  @$this->Attachment->upload@ in order to reference the file.
